*--- REQUIREMENTS ---*
R (only version 1.1.456 tested) with stringr, ape, ggplot2, rlang, stringi, dplyr, tidyr
Arlequin with a console version (no console version also works if you aim to analyze only a few alleles)


*--- INSTALLATION ---*
1. Install Rstudio and Arlequin (if you are under linux, the executable file is already present in the github repository). 
2. Download github repository  'mathjoss/Alfred2FST '
3. Install the necessary packages


*--- INPUT FILE ---*
A text file from ALFRED database (https://alfred.med.yale.edu/alfred/index.asp)
We used : 
 - Microhap_alleleF_198.txt from https://alfred.med.yale.edu/alfred/alfredDataDownload.asp
 - Allele frequencies from FROG-kb: http://frog.med.yale.edu/FrogKB/docFreqDownload.jsp


*--- OUTPUTFILE ---*
 - A csv file with FST for all population (distance matrix)


*--- INSTRUCTIONS FOR OPERATION ---*
1. Download your input file from Alfred of FROG-kb.

2. Create an empty folder where you want to store the Arlequin file for each allele frequency. 

3. Open alfredtxt2arlequin.R file. Enter the path where you stored the input file, path of the empty folder, and change name for input and output file.
--> this step will create one text file for each allele. If you want to gather all allele in a single file, use alfredtxt2arlequin_gather1file.R. However, with this file, it's too heavy for Arlequin...

4. Place the following files in the same folder that contains all the .arl file just created: 
- arlecore.exe file (in our case, arlecore3522_64bit)
- arl_run.ars (where you might change things according to what you exactly want: in our case, we selected many information such as FST, population comparaison, etc...)
- LaunchArlecore.sh, where you need to change the name of two files if needed.

5. Run LaunchArlecore.sh (then takes around 15 min per files)

6. The output is a set of folders. Use the file mean_all_files.R to get a set of files with the data that is interesting to you (only a clear txt file and not a whole set a folders, files..) In our case we selected only FST but it can be change manually in the code.

7. Run the file mean_all_files_part2.R to mean all those files together, and get a single table. (go through this whole file to change path and file names!)

8. Additional step: compute MultiDimensional Scaling with this distance matrix with extract_MDS.R. Choose the number of dimensions, plot Goodness of fit and R squared..
